 <h1>About Whitesands School</h1><hr></hr>
    <p> Whitesands School, a project of Ikota Educational Foundation (IEF), is a boysâ€™, day secondary school, open to students of all backgrounds, without religious, cultural or ethnic discrimination. The school began its first classes on October 2, 2000. The school follows the educational model of successful, parents-promoted educational institutions that have been in existence in many parts of the world for over four decades.</p>
        <h2>Our Structure</h2><hr></hr>
       <p>Our educational model is based on the set of principles that ensures an adequate training to each student, both at school and in the family.At the request of IEF, the Prelature of Opus Dei, an institution of the Catholic Church, provides spiritual and doctrinal formation to the students, staff and parents of the school, without assuming legal or moral responsibility for the school.</p>
        
       <p>Whitesands School is administered by a Management Council appointed by the Board of Governors whose members in turn are appointed by the Board of Trustees of the IEF. Members of the council are all staff of the school. The Management Council is a collegial body led and headed by the Principal who is the chief executive and accounting officer of the school. Other members of the council include the Vice Principal, Junior School; the Vice Principal, Senior School, and the Head of Administration.</p>
        <h3>Our Branches</h3><hr></hr>
       <p> The school has two main branches: the junior and the senior branches.  Each has its own vice principal who oversees all matters related to academics, personal formation and other activities of the branch.  The vice principals are supported by group coordinators who manage a team of educators (subject teachers, advisors, teachers in charge, etc). </p>
        <p>Whitesands School follows the Nigerian National Curriculum for secondary schools which consists of three years of junior secondary and three years of senior secondary schooling which qualifies the students to sit for the West African Senior Secondary Certificate of Education (WASSCE) examinations.  This curriculum is widened to accommodate the Cambridge IGCSE and the SAT of the US.</p>
        
        <p>The school places a lot of value on personal formation.  By personal formation we refer to the entire education that a student receives at Whitesands School.  The academic programme, extra and co-curricular activities, advisory system and spiritual means of formation, and even the facilities all contribute to the formation of a person with intellect and will.  Everything done in Whitesands is done for the sake of the total personal development of the students.</p>
        <h3>Our Aesthetics</h3><hr></hr>
        <p>The school campus is in a two-hectare plot in Lekki, an area of Lagos with new urban development in the last decade.  Whitesands School has over 5000 square meters of built-up floor area for classrooms, labs and common facilities.  There is also a recently-built 2400 square meter multi-purpose covered court.</p>
        
        <p>The school has had eleven sets of graduates, with a total of more than 600 students. Over seventy percent of the graduates pursue their university studies abroad mainly the UK, US and Canadian universities including the top universities like Harvard College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Imperial College, Oxford University, University of Toronto, etc. The first sets of students have finished their undergraduate studies and some have their masters degrees. A handful of graduates received distinctions and scholarships.</p>
